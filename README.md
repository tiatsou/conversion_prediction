Analysis project refreshing from leisure time, will update from time to time and many to come!

This dataset contains anonymized marketing touchpoint data, including a conversion label column. I will explore the dataset using Sweetviz to gain insights of this data, build simple classification models as a baseline evaluated by Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve and AUC. And then attempt to improve model performance by focusing on data quality. Two approaches will be used for improving classification predictions: hyperparameter tuning and addressing imbalanced data.

Step by step of this anaysis can be found in the script.
